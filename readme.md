Brockstar
=========

I develop it with QtCreator, but you can probably compile it with `gcc -std=c++20 *.cpp -o brockstar`.

Based on the spec, here a list of things not yet implemented:
* `Modify`
* splitting strings
* joining arrays
* `Cast`
* real maths operator (`A times B` works but `A * B` is an error)
* `listen to`
* loops (missing `break` and `continue`)
